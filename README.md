## Theory :
Probably the most well known attack in cybersecurity is the Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
A mechanism that helps combat such attacks is called SSL pinning. 

## Objectives :
__1.Create a native mobile application which performs authentication via a 3â€™rd party;
__2. Implement SSL pinning to combat MITM attacks;
_3. Prove the effectiveness of the implemented mechanism (via video).
